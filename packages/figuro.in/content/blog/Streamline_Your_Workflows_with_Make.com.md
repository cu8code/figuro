### **How Does Make.com Work?**

Make.com uses a modular approach to automation. Each workflow (or "scenario") consists of:
1. **Triggers**: Events that start the workflow (e.g., a new email in Gmail or a new row in Google Sheets).
2. **Actions**: Tasks performed after the trigger (e.g., sending a Slack message or updating a CRM).
3. **Filters**: Conditions that determine whether an action should be executed.
4. **Routers**: Split workflows into multiple paths based on specific criteria.

For example, you could create a scenario that:
1. Triggers when a new order is placed on Shopify.
2. Updates your inventory in Airtable.
3. Sends a confirmation email to the customer via Gmail.
