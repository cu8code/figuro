Hello! I'm a **${new Date().getFullYear() - 2004}-year-old** software developer from Kolkata.

With over **${new Date().getFullYear() - 2022}-year** of experience in the industry, I have a passion for creating innovative solutions. I enjoy **anime**, though the recent privacy restrictions have limited my viewing time.

I thrive on learning and sharing information, and I believe that no one is inherently smarter than anyone else; we are all just navigating our own paths of knowledge. I strive to remain humble and cherish the time spent with my family.

My aspiration is to dedicate myself to a meaningful cause, which I am still in the process of discovering!

This project was inspired by a video from @theo, where he shared that he was charging $6 for 100 images. At the time, I was skeptical, thinking I could do better. However, I soon realized the value of creating a simple, efficient solution for removing backgrounds, and this project became my response to that challenge.
