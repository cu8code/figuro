# Figuro Projects Repository

Welcome to the Figuro Projects Repository! This repository hosts all my projects, organized in one place for easy access and collaboration. It includes three major projects:

- **remove-background.figuro.in**: A platform to remove backgrounds for free in bulk. This tool allows users to remove backgrounds from images efficiently and provides a custom editor for editing masks, making it easier to fine-tune images before downloading or copying them.

- **cal.figuro.in**: A unique calendar interface that displays the year in dots, designed for individuals with a particular interest in visualizing time in a non-traditional way. Ideal for those who prefer a different approach to seeing time unfold.

- **figuro.in**: The main landing page of the site, serving as the gateway to all the services and features offered. It provides navigation and access to the various tools and projects hosted under the Figuro brand.
